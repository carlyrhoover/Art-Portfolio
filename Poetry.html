        <h2>Divine Wiring</h2>
        <p> 
            New programming and systems analysis. <br>
            Voltage, current, diesel generators and Trojan horse programs. <br>
            Security, technology, and human nature. <br>
            A human operator? Give blood to me. <br>
            The physical and cyber world <br>

            A fence 8 feet high topped with concertina wire signals. <br>
            A greater need to keep intruders out. <br>
            And sometimes, to keep people in. <br>

            Detection of an intruder. <br>
            Subversion error is fooling the system over time. <br>
            The security of these mechanisms, a chain is only as good as its weakest link. <br>

            Cyberterrorism, cyberweapons, and cyberwars. <br>
            This piece of malware was designed to sabotage plants, to damage industrial systems. <br>
            Things even more insidious than that. <br>
