        <h2>Divine Wiring</h2>
        <p> 
            New programming and systems analysis. <br>
            Voltage, current, diesel generators and Trojan horse programs. <br>
            Security, technology, and human nature. <br>
            A human operator? Give blood to me. <br>
            The physical and cyber world <br>

            A fence 8 feet high topped with concertina wire signals. <br>
            A greater need to keep intruders out. <br>
            And sometimes, to keep people in. <br>

            Detection of an intruder. <br>
            Subversion error is fooling the system over time. <br>
            The security of these mechanisms, a chain is only as good as its weakest link. <br>

            Cyberterrorism, cyberweapons, and cyberwars. <br>
            This piece of malware was designed to sabotage plants, to damage industrial systems. <br>
            Things even more insidious than that. <br>

        <h2>O King of Kings!</h2>
        <p>
            O King of Kings! Your dastardly plan has come to fruition. <br>
            Mutually assured destruction kept at bay. <br>
            No warheads. No fallout. <br>

	        Your Majesty! <br>
            Your Majesty! <br>
			Your Majesty! You’ve won, but at what cost? <br>

            Rise, and see the city you’ve level’d. <br>
            Three million lambs, sent to slaughter. <br>
            Your scale tip’d, three million exchanged for seven billion. <br>

            O King of Kings! Have you no heart? <br> 
            Is your head filled with only thoughts of yourself? <br>
            Your Majesty does not answer, no answer am I worthy. <br>
            No answer do I deserve. <br>

            (In reference to the Watchmen character, Ozymandius, who averted nuclear warfare by attacking New York City, effectively uniting the world) <br>
